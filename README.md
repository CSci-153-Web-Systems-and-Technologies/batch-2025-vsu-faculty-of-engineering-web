# VSU Faculty & Admin Website

A Nuxt 3 web application for the Faculty of Engineering Technology (FOC) of Visayas State University.

The system has:

- 🌐 Public-facing site – news, events, admission, academics, research, downloads, department personnel, OBE, etc.  
- 🔐 Role-based admin dashboard – separate panels for Super Admin, Head Admin, and Faculty, with fine-grained module access controlled by the Super Admin.

Built with **Nuxt 3**, **Vue 3**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **VueFire (Firebase)**, and **UIthing**.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher  
- npm (or pnpm/yarn)  
- A Firebase project with:  
  - Authentication enabled (Email/Password)  
  - Firestore database  
  - Storage bucket  

### 1. Clone the Repository

    git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>.git
    cd <PROJECT_FOLDER>

### 2. Install Dependencies

    npm install

### 3. Configure Firebase

In the Firebase Console:

1. Create (or choose) a project.  
2. Create a Web App and copy the config (`apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`, `storageBucket`, `messagingSenderId`, `appId`).  
3. Enable:  
   - Authentication → Email/Password  
   - Firestore Database  
   - Storage  

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (same level as `nuxt.config.ts`):

    NUXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    NUXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your_project.firebaseapp.com"
    NUXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your_project_id"
    NUXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your_project.appspot.com"
    NUXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="sender_id"
    NUXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="app_id"

Make sure these keys match what is used in your Nuxt/VueFire plugin configuration.

Do **not** commit the `.env` file or any real credentials.

---

## Development Commands

Start development server:

    npm run dev

Default URL: `http://localhost:3000`

Build for production:

    npm run build

Preview the production build locally:

    npm run preview

---

## Routing Overview

Nuxt uses file-based routing. Key routes:

### Public

- `/` → `pages/index.vue`  
- `/login` → `pages/login.vue`  
- `/about/*` → `pages/about/*.vue`  
- `/academics/*` → `pages/academics/*.vue`  
- `/admission/*` → `pages/admission/*.vue`  
- `/events` and `/events/[id]` → `pages/events/*.vue`  
- `/news` and `/news/[id]` → `pages/news/*.vue`  
- `/download` → `pages/download/*.vue`  
- `/research` → `pages/research/*.vue`  
- `/obe` → `pages/obe/*.vue`  
- `/search` → `pages/search.vue`  

### Admin

- `/Admin/faculty` → faculty profile
- `/Admin/head-admin` → faculty profile and department/degree program pages
- `/Admin/super-admin` → super admin dashboard and subpages  

Route access is guarded with middleware for authentication and role-based checks, plus extra checks for module permissions where needed.

---

## Firestore Data Model (Overview)

The exact fields may vary, but the system typically uses:

- `users`  
  - `uid`, `email`, `displayName`, `role` (`super-admin`, `head-admin`, `faculty`), `departmentId`  
  - `permissions` or similar field for module-level access (news, events, research, downloads, about, admission, OBE, gallery, socials, etc.)  
  - Profile data  

- `departments`  
  - `id`, `name`, `code`, `headAdminId`, and other department metadata  
  - Subcollection: `degreePrograms`  
    - `id`, `name`, `level`, `content`, and related information  

- `department_pages`  
  - Document ID = `departmentId`  
  - `coverImageUrl`, `content` (rich HTML from Tiptap)  

- `news`  
  - `title`, `description`, `content`, `coverImageUrl`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `authorId`  

- `events`  
  - `title`, `description`, `content`, `date`, `coverImages[]`, `status`, `createdAt`  

- `about_sections`  
  - Examples: `history`, `facilities`, `vision_mission`, etc., each storing rich HTML content  

- `admission_sections`  
  - `why_choose_vsu`, `undergraduate`, `graduate`  

- `college_faculty_staff` – faculty-wide staff collection  
    - This collection name is reused from the previous “College of Engineering” version of the system and now represents the Faculty of Engineering.

- `downloads`
  - Stores page content only (author, Tiptap HTML in `content`).  
    Actual downloadable files are not stored here; they are linked via URLs inside the HTML.

- `researches`  
  - Research entries

All Firestore reads and writes are handled via VueFire in composables and page components, with security rules enforcing role and permission checks.

---

## Coding Conventions

- Use TypeScript in components and composables:  
  - `<script setup lang="ts">`  

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.  

- Use UIthing and components from `components/Ui` for consistent styling and behavior.  

- Use VueFire for all Firebase operations (Authentication, Firestore, Storage).  

- Enforce role-based and module-based access in:  
  - Middleware (navigation guards)  
  - Firestore security rules  
  - UI (hide or disable actions that the current role or user does not have permission to perform)
